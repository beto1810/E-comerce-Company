- Regarding to Product : Overall, We can give a comment is that family stuffs are favorable items of Bazilians. With the development of economics, Brazilians also want to improve their life experience with useful home furniture and beauty items.

- Relating to the trending purchase of Brazilians, Overall, we can see that E-commerce has experience a sustainable development of total order time by time. Especially , November of 2017, There was a dramatical increasing of ordering, one of explanation for this events is the [Proclamation of the Republic of Brazil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proclamation_of_the_Republic_(Brazil)). I believe that E-commerce company had took advantage of this event to promote the business.

- Boat made by GRP material is significantly hot in the current market with over 70% of total market boat material
- Some super boat with price over higher 1million Europe choose GRP as its core material. 

-> GRP is lighter and stronger and Itâ€™s easier for boat owners to repair boats.

- Condition :
  - Used boat accounts for majority of total listed on website.
  - New condition boat also receive attention of consumer as you can see here, there no much significant different of avarage view between 3 type of boatâ€™s condition

-> Used boat got a little bit more attractive by it got advantage of price than new boat

- Engine : Boat use diesel and Unleaded engine are most popurlar type

# 6. Conclusion & Recommendation

- In Last 7 days, Nearly New Nautical Website has experienced some significant numbers as:
  - Nearly New Nautical Website had 1.4 millions of views and about 10,000 boats posted.
  - Top 3 Boat Type by views are Motor Yacht, Sport Boat, Cabin Boat.
  - High price boat does not attract viewers instead of Low price boat.
  - GRP is the most popular material of boat.
  - Diesel and Unleaded Engine boat account for more than 98% of total boat.
  - Europe countries, especially Switzerland got the highest amount of boat listed on website.



- ðŸš© So, I believe that Nearly New Nautical Website should:
  - Design Special Newsletter base on top countries like Switzerland, Germany, Italy or they can consider have special sections relating to top countries as their landscape, lake, river, beach etc.
  - Recommend some top manufacturer and have interview with management teams of these manufacturers.
  - With sales section, newsletter should give some useful insight to boat owners relating type of boat, price, material.
  - Thinking about broadening market to North America.
